简单介绍 Resource接口

# 简述
Interface for a resource descriptor that abstracts from the actual type of underlying resource,
 such as a file or class path resource.

上面是Resource接口的doc描述，很明确的定义了接口的职责。它是资源的抽象，为应用提供了统一的访问api。

## resource 接口方法


``
public interface Resource extends InputStreamSource {

	/**
	 * Return whether this resource actually exists in physical form.
	 * <p>This method performs a definitive existence check, whereas the
	 * existence of a {@code Resource} handle only guarantees a
	 * valid descriptor handle.
	 */
	boolean exists();

	/**
	 * Return whether the contents of this resource can be read,
	 * e.g. via {@link #getInputStream()} or {@link #getFile()}.
	 * <p>Will be {@code true} for typical resource descriptors;
	 * note that actual content reading may still fail when attempted.
	 * However, a value of {@code false} is a definitive indication
	 * that the resource content cannot be read.
	 * @see #getInputStream()
	 */
	boolean isReadable();

	/**
	 * Return whether this resource represents a handle with an open
	 * stream. If true, the InputStream cannot be read multiple times,
	 * and must be read and closed to avoid resource leaks.
	 * <p>Will be {@code false} for typical resource descriptors.
	 */
	boolean isOpen();

	/**
	 * Return a URL handle for this resource.
	 * @throws IOException if the resource cannot be resolved as URL,
	 * i.e. if the resource is not available as descriptor
	 */
	URL getURL() throws IOException;

	/**
	 * Return a URI handle for this resource.
	 * @throws IOException if the resource cannot be resolved as URI,
	 * i.e. if the resource is not available as descriptor
	 */
	URI getURI() throws IOException;

	/**
	 * Return a File handle for this resource.
	 * @throws IOException if the resource cannot be resolved as absolute
	 * file path, i.e. if the resource is not available in a file system
	 */
	File getFile() throws IOException;

	/**
	 * Determine the content length for this resource.
	 * @throws IOException if the resource cannot be resolved
	 * (in the file system or as some other known physical resource type)
	 */
	long contentLength() throws IOException;

	/**
	 * Determine the last-modified timestamp for this resource.
	 * @throws IOException if the resource cannot be resolved
	 * (in the file system or as some other known physical resource type)
	 */
	long lastModified() throws IOException;

	/**
	 * Create a resource relative to this resource.
	 * @param relativePath the relative path (relative to this resource)
	 * @return the resource handle for the relative resource
	 * @throws IOException if the relative resource cannot be determined
	 */
	Resource createRelative(String relativePath) throws IOException;

	/**
	 * Determine a filename for this resource, i.e. typically the last
	 * part of the path: for example, "myfile.txt".
	 * <p>Returns {@code null} if this type of resource does not
	 * have a filename.
	 */
	String getFilename();

	/**
	 * Return a description for this resource,
	 * to be used for error output when working with the resource.
	 * <p>Implementations are also encouraged to return this value
	 * from their {@code toString} method.
	 * @see Object#toString()
	 */
	String getDescription();
}

public interface InputStreamSource {

	/**
	 * Return an {@link InputStream}.
	 * <p>It is expected that each call creates a <i>fresh</i> stream.
	 * <p>This requirement is particularly important when you consider an API such
	 * as JavaMail, which needs to be able to read the stream multiple times when
	 * creating mail attachments. For such a use case, it is <i>required</i>
	 * that each {@code getInputStream()} call returns a fresh stream.
	 * @return the input stream for the underlying resource (must not be {@code null})
	 * @throws IOException if the stream could not be opened
	 * @see org.springframework.mail.javamail.MimeMessageHelper#addAttachment(String, InputStreamSource)
